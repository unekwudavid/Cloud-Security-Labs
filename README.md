## 👨‍💻 Profile Snapshot  

Hi, I’m **David Adama**, an aspiring **Cloud Security Professional** with a strong focus on **identity management, compliance, and governance** in cloud environments.  
I hold an **ISO 27001 Certification**, reflecting my understanding of international standards for **information security management systems (ISMS)**.  

This repository documents my **hands-on cloud security labs**, where I implement, test, and refine **real-world security configurations** across Microsoft 365, Azure, and other cloud platforms.  
It serves as a **portfolio of practical experience** demonstrating how I secure, monitor, and enforce compliance within enterprise-grade cloud systems.  


## 🌍 Overview  

The **Cloud Security Labs Repository** is a curated collection of **projects, configurations, and security exercises** that showcase my ability to:  
- Implement **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and **Zero Trust principles**  
- Strengthen **data protection**, **audit readiness**, and **governance frameworks**  
- Conduct **security posture assessments** across cloud infrastructures  
- Apply **ISO 27001**, **NIST**, and **CIS Benchmark** controls in practical environments  


## 🎯 Objectives  

This repository aims to:  
- Demonstrate **hands-on proficiency** in securing multi-cloud infrastructures.  
- Showcase **compliance alignment** through configuration and monitoring.  
- Reflect **real-world use cases** in Microsoft Defender, Purview, and Entra ID.  
- Serve as a **technical reference portfolio** for cloud security roles.
